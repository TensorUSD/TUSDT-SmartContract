# TUSDT Contracts Workspace

Ink! contracts for a collateralized TUSDT system with vault borrowing, a lending/borrowing pool,
liquidation auctions, and on-chain governance plus a treasury that books protocol fees.

The contracts split into three layers:

- **Protocol** — `tusdt-erc20` (token, multi-minter), `tusdt-vault-alpha` (CDP borrowing/liquidation
  backed by subnet alpha), `tusdt-lending-pool` (TAO/TUSDT lending with alpha collateral, lToken
  receipt tokens, utilization-based interest rates), `tusdt-auction` (ascending-bid liquidation
  auctions for the vault), `tusdt-oracle` (collateral pricing).
  The vault owns the token/auction/oracle instances it creates; the lending pool spawns its own lToken
  children.
- **Governance & treasury** — `tusdt-governance` (token-holder proposals plus a maintainer/council
  authority that steers the protocol contracts) and `tusdt-treasury` (per-fund accounting for fees,
  released only by governance).

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- `cargo-contract`
- Node.js + Yarn (for the isolated contract tooling under `tools/`)
- A Contracts-enabled Substrate node (local or remote)

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked cargo-contract
```

## Build

Build all crates:

```bash
cargo check
```

Build contract artifacts (`.contract`, `.wasm`, metadata):

```bash
cargo contract build --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-erc20/Cargo.toml --release
cargo contract build --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-auction/Cargo.toml --release
cargo contract build --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-oracle/Cargo.toml --release

cargo contract build --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-governance/Cargo.toml --release
cargo contract build --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-election/Cargo.toml --release
```

Artifacts are produced in `target/ink/`.

## Lint, Format & Test

```bash
# Format all Rust source files
cargo fmt -- --check

# Lint with clippy (deny warnings)
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

```

CI gate: `cargo fmt -- --check && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace`

## Contract Tooling (`tools/`)

Shared deployment scripts and on-chain tests live in an isolated TypeScript subproject under `tools/`.
The current iteration exposes upload support for `erc20`, `auction`, `oracle`, and `vault-alpha`, plus a single `vault-alpha` deployment entrypoint. The `treasury`, `governance`, and `election` upload scripts are also available.

Setup:

```bash
cd tools
yarn install
cp .env.example .env
```

Default `.env` values target a local dev node:

- `WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:9944`

Scripts and tests use the standard local dev accounts (`//Alice`, `//Bob`, `//Charlie`, `//Dave`, `//Eve`, `//Ferdie`) from the shared dev-account helper.
When needed, you can override the selected account via SURI environment variables such as `CONTRACT_UPLOADER=//Alice`, `CONTRACT_DEPLOYER=//Alice`.

Useful commands:

```bash
cd tools
yarn build:erc20-artifacts
yarn build:auction-artifacts
yarn build:oracle-artifacts
yarn build:vault-artifacts
yarn erc20:upload
yarn auction:upload
yarn oracle:upload
yarn vault:upload
yarn vault:deploy --token-code-hash <TOKEN_CODE_HASH> --auction-code-hash <AUCTION_CODE_HASH> --oracle-code-hash <ORACLE_CODE_HASH> --treasury-address <SS58> --oracle-netuid <NETUID> --hotkey <SS58>
yarn test:oracle
```

## Deployment (Recommended Order)

`tusdt-vault-alpha::new` takes a `treasury` address, code hashes for token/auction/oracle,
`oracle_netuid` (subnet for oracle reporters), and `hotkey` (staking hotkey for alpha collateral).
The vault instantiates the token, auction, and oracle internally. Because the vault *creates* the
TUSDT token, the token address is not known until the vault exists — deploy the treasury after the
vault and wire it in via `update_treasury`.

1. Upload ERC20 code (`tusdt-erc20`) and capture code hash.
2. Upload Auction code (`tusdt-auction`) and capture code hash.
3. Upload Oracle code (`tusdt-oracle`) and capture code hash.
4. Instantiate Alpha Vault (`tusdt-vault-alpha::new`) with:
   - `treasury` — a placeholder address for now (e.g. the deployer); reassigned in step 7.
   - `token_code_hash`
   - `auction_code_hash`
   - `oracle_code_hash`
   - `oracle_netuid` — subnet whose registered neurons may submit oracle prices
   - `hotkey` — staking hotkey for alpha collateral deposits

   The deployer becomes the initial governance of the vault, auction, and oracle.
5. Read the token / auction / oracle addresses from the vault (`get_token_address`,
   `get_auction_address`, `get_oracle_address`).
6. Instantiate Treasury (`tusdt-treasury::new`) with the vault's TUSDT token address.
7. Wire the vault's fee recipient: `tusdt-vault-alpha::update_treasury(treasury)`.
8. Add vault as minter on ERC20: `tusdt-erc20::add_minter(vault_address)`.
9. Upload Election code (`tusdt-election`) and capture code hash.
10. Instantiate Governance (`tusdt-governance::new`) with the `treasury`, `vault`, `auction`, `oracle`
    addresses, initial `maintainer`, and `election_code_hash`.
11. Hand control to the governance contract:
    - `tusdt-treasury::set_governance(governance)`
    - `tusdt-vault-alpha::update_governance(governance)` — propagates to auction and oracle too.
12. Seat the council: `tusdt-governance::set_council([c1..c5])`.
13. Approve target subnets: `tusdt-governance::vault_set_approved_netuid(N, true)` for each subnet.
14. Configure per-netuid params: `tusdt-governance::vault_set_contract_params(N, params)` for each
    subnet (24h timelock, then anyone calls `tusdt-vault-alpha::execute_contract_params_update(N)`).
15. (Optional) Adjust global params: `tusdt-governance::vault_set_global_params(config)` (24h
    timelock, then anyone calls `tusdt-vault-alpha::execute_global_params_update()`).

After step 11 the protocol contracts are steered exclusively by the governance contract, and within
governance the maintainer/council split (see [Governance & Treasury](#governance--treasury)) applies.

Example CLI for the protocol layer (adjust URL/account):

```bash
cargo contract upload \
  --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-erc20/Cargo.toml \
  --suri //Alice --url ws://127.0.0.1:9944

cargo contract upload \
  --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-auction/Cargo.toml \
  --suri //Alice --url ws://127.0.0.1:9944

cargo contract upload \
  --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-oracle/Cargo.toml \
  --suri //Alice --url ws://127.0.0.1:9944

cargo contract instantiate \
  --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-vault-alpha/Cargo.toml \
  --constructor new \
  --args <TREASURY_OR_PLACEHOLDER> <ERC20_CODE_HASH> <AUCTION_CODE_HASH> <ORACLE_CODE_HASH> <ORACLE_NETUID> <HOTKEY> <ALPHA_PRICE_NETUID> \
  --suri //Alice --url ws://127.0.0.1:9944
```

Then deploy the governance layer and wire the roles:

```bash
cargo contract instantiate \
  --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-treasury/Cargo.toml \
  --constructor new \
  --args <TUSDT_TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  --suri //Alice --url ws://127.0.0.1:9944

cargo contract upload \
  --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-election/Cargo.toml \
  --suri //Alice --url ws://127.0.0.1:9944

cargo contract instantiate \
  --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-governance/Cargo.toml \
  --constructor new \
  --args <TREASURY_ADDRESS> <VAULT_ADDRESS> <AUCTION_ADDRESS> <ORACLE_ADDRESS> <MAINTAINER> \
         <ELECTION_CODE_HASH> \
  --suri //Alice --url ws://127.0.0.1:9944
```

Prefer the `tools/` workflow above instead of using `cargo contract` for upload/deploy operations
where a TS script already exists. The current e2e test suite is intentionally oracle-only, the only
deployment script entrypoint is `vault:deploy`, and the treasury/governance/election contracts have
no TS scripts yet — deploy and wire them with `cargo contract` as shown.

## Lending Pool

The lending pool (`tusdt-lending-pool`) is a standalone protocol contract that enables:

- **Supply TAO/TUSDT** to earn variable yield (receive lTAO/lTUSDT receipt tokens)
- **Supply Alpha collateral** (one market per approved subnet) to gain borrowing power
- **Borrow TAO/TUSDT** against Alpha collateral with health factor checks
- **Direct liquidation** when health factor drops below 1.0 (close factor 50%, configurable bonus)

### Deployment (Lending Pool)

1. Upload the lending pool code and capture the code hash:
   ```bash
   cargo contract upload \
     --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-lending-pool/Cargo.toml \
     --suri //Alice --url ws://127.0.0.1:9944
   ```
2. Instantiate the pool with the existing treasury, TUSDT token, oracle, lToken code hash (reuses
   `tusdt-erc20` code), and a staking hotkey:
   ```bash
   cargo contract instantiate \
     --manifest-path contracts/tusdt-lending-pool/Cargo.toml \
     --constructor new \
     --args <TREASURY_ADDRESS> <TUSDT_TOKEN_ADDRESS> <ORACLE_ADDRESS> \
            <LTOKEN_CODE_HASH> <POOL_HOTKEY> \
     --suri //Alice --url ws://127.0.0.1:9944
   ```
   The pool spawns two child lToken instances (lTAO for market 0, lTUSDT for market 1).
3. Read the spawned lToken addresses:
   - `pool.get_ltoken_address(0)` → lTAO
   - `pool.get_ltoken_address(1)` → lTUSDT
4. Approve alpha markets: `pool.add_alpha_market(netuid, params)` for each target subnet.
5. (Optional) Wire governance: `pool.update_governance(governance_address)`, then call
   `governance.update_pool_address(pool_address)` to record the pool in the governance contract.
6. (Optional) Adjust interest rate params, alpha params, or global params via timelocked updates.

### Lending pool lifecycle

1. **Supply**: Users deposit TAO (payable) or TUSDT (`transfer_from`) → receive lTAO/lTUSDT at the
   current exchange rate. Exchange rate starts at 1.0 and grows as interest accrues.
2. **Supply Alpha collateral**: Users call `deposit_alpha(netuid, amount)` → atomically pulls the
   caller's alpha stake into the pool's coldkey via chain extension func 25 (same mechanism as the
   vault). One market per approved subnet.
3. **Borrow**: Users with alpha collateral can borrow TAO or TUSDT. Borrowing power is:
   `collateral_value × collateral_factor − existing_debt`. Health factor must stay ≥ 1.0.
4. **Repay**: Repay TAO (payable) or TUSDT (`transfer_from`). Repaid assets stay as pool liquidity —
   no burn. Interest accrues continuously while borrowed.
5. **Withdraw collateral**: Only allowed when the account remains healthy after withdrawal. Uses
   chain extension func 6 (`transfer_stake`) to return stake to the user's coldkey.
6. **Liquidate**: Permissionless. When `health_factor < 1.0`, any account can repay a portion of the
   borrower's debt (up to 50% close factor) and receive discounted alpha collateral (configurable
   bonus, default 5%).

### Interest rate model

- **Utilization-based** 2-zone curve: `U = total_debt / (total_debt + cash)`.
  - Zone 1 (U ≤ optimal): `base_rate + slope1 × U / optimal`
  - Zone 2 (U > optimal): `base_rate + slope1 + slope2 × (U − optimal) / (1 − optimal)`
- **Discrete hourly compounding** via `checked_pow` — same primitives as the vault's former interest
  model.
- **Reserve factor** (default 20%): share of borrower interest sent to the protocol treasury.
  `supplier_rate = borrow_rate × U × (1 − reserve_factor)`.
- **lToken exchange rate**: `underlying = ltoken_balance × exchange_rate`. Exchange rate starts at
  1.0 and grows monotonically as supplier interest accrues. Non-rebasing (Compound-style).

### Alpha yield performance fee

Alpha collateral continues earning native staking yield while supplied. A permissionless
`claim_alpha_yield(netuid)` function:

1. Computes excess = actual available stake − booked collateral (accounting for yield index).
2. Splits 25% → treasury (unstaked to TAO via `remove_stake`, transferred as native TAO).
3. Credits 75% → per-netuid yield index, proportionally increasing all borrowers' effective collateral.

### Default parameters

| Asset | base_rate | slope1 | slope2 | optimal_util | reserve_factor |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| TAO   | 0%        | 4%     | 96%    | 80%         | 20%            |
| TUSDT | 0%        | 3%     | 97%    | 80%         | 20%            |

| Alpha param         | Default |
|---------------------|---------|
| Collateral factor   | 50%     |
| Liquidation threshold | 60%   |
| Liquidation bonus   | 5%      |

| Global param        | Default |
|---------------------|---------|
| Close factor        | 50%     |
| Performance fee     | 25%     |
| Max oracle age      | 30 min  |

### Useful pool read methods

- `get_market_state(market_id)` → `MarketState` (total_supplied, total_debt, borrow_index, exchange_rate, reserve_accrued)
- `get_position(market_id, user)` → `Position` (ltoken_balance, scaled_debt, alpha_principal)
- `get_exchange_rate(market_id)`, `get_borrow_index(market_id)`, `get_utilization(market_id)`
- `get_borrow_rate(market_id)`, `get_supply_rate(market_id)` — current annualized rates
- `get_underlying_balance(market_id, user)` → underlying value of lToken position
- `get_user_debt(market_id, user)` → current debt in underlying units
- `get_collateral_value_tusdt(user)`, `get_debt_value_tusdt(user)`, `get_health_factor(user)`
- `get_available_borrow_tusdt(user)` → remaining borrowing capacity in TUSDT
- `get_alpha_markets()` → `Vec<(netuid, AlphaMarketParams)>` — list all approved alpha markets
- `get_user_alpha_position(user, netuid)` → alpha principal for a specific subnet
- `get_alpha_yield_index(netuid)`, `get_netuid_total_collateral(netuid)`
- `paused()`, `governance()`, `treasury()`, `platform()`, `get_pool_hotkey()`, `get_oracle_address()`
- Paginated: `get_positions(user, page)`, `get_all_positions(page)` (10 per page)

### Governance forwarders

After wiring (`pool.update_governance(governance)`), the governance contract can steer the pool:

| Forwarder | Gated by | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `pool_set_approved_netuid(netuid, approved)` | maintainer | Add/remove alpha collateral markets |
| `pool_set_market_params(market, config)` / cancel | maintainer | Schedule timelocked interest rate changes |
| `pool_set_alpha_params(netuid, config)` / cancel | maintainer | Schedule timelocked alpha param changes |
| `pool_set_global_params(config)` / cancel | maintainer | Schedule timelocked global param changes |
| `pool_pause` | council | Emergency halt (single member) |
| `pool_unpause` | maintainer | Resume operations |
| `pool_update_pool_hotkey(new_hotkey, netuids)` | maintainer | Migrate alpha stake to new hotkey |

All param changes follow the 24h timelock: schedule (governance) → execute (permissionless, time-gated)
→ cancel (governance). Params can be read at any time via `get_pending_*_params_update`.

## Working Flow

### 1) Vault lifecycle (atomic pull deposit)

1. User stakes alpha under the vault's hotkey (if not already staked there) — the pull keeps the hotkey.
2. User creates vault: `create_alpha_vault(amount, netuid)` — the contract atomically pulls `amount`
   of the caller's alpha into its own coldkey via the caller-forwarded `caller_transfer_stake`
   chain extension (function 25) and opens the CDP in the same message. Deposits are always
   attributed to the caller; no separate intent or `transfer_stake` extrinsic is needed.
   Requires the subnet's `TransferToggle` to be on and the amount to exceed the chain's minimum
   stake (0.002 TAO equivalent); failures revert cleanly with `StakeTransferFailed`.
3. User borrows token: `borrow_token(vault_id, amount)`.
4. User repays token: `repay_token(vault_id, amount)`.
5. Anyone can trigger debt accrual: `accrue_interest(owner, vault_id)`.
6. User adds more alpha collateral: `add_alpha_collateral(vault_id, amount)` — pulls exactly
   `amount` from the caller, same mechanism as vault creation.
7. User releases alpha collateral: `release_alpha_collateral(vault_id, amount, dest_coldkey)` — returns stake via chain extension.

Deposit messages are EOA-facing: a contract calling the vault would pull its own stake, since the
chain extension forwards the immediate caller's origin.

### 2) Interest model

- Accrual is hour-based.
- The configured `interest_rate` is an APR-style annual rate, not a simple yearly charge.
- Growth model uses discrete hourly compounding from that annual rate.
- At the default `5%` APR, the effective annualized cost is approximately `5.13%` APY under hourly compounding.
- Implementation compounds by elapsed full hours and advances `last_interest_accrued_at` to the last fully accrued hour.

### 3) Liquidation flow

1. Anyone can call `trigger_liquidation_auction(owner, vault_id)` when vault exceeds liquidation threshold.
2. Auction contract creates an auction tied to that vault.
3. Bidders approve token allowance to auction contract, then call `place_bid`.
4. After end time, call `finalize_auction` on auction contract.
5. Vault settlement: `settle_liquidation_auction(owner, vault_id)`.

### 4) Admin flow

Privileged protocol actions are gated by each contract's `governance` role. Before hand-off this is
the deployer; after wiring (deployment steps 7 & 9) it is the **governance contract**, and you drive
them through governance's forwarders rather than calling the protocol contracts directly. See
[Governance & Treasury](#governance--treasury) for who may invoke what.

Risk params split into two scopes, both applied behind a 24h timelock:

- **Per-netuid** — governance schedules `set_contract_params(netuid, params)` per subnet. Params:
  `collateral_ratio`, `liquidation_ratio`, `interest_rate`, `liquidation_fee` (all basis points).
  Falls back to defaults for unconfigured netuids.
- **Global (all netuids)** — governance schedules `set_global_params(config)`. Params:
  `transaction_fee` (basis points), `auction_duration_ms`, `max_oracle_age_ms`.

Governance also controls which subnets are accepted via `set_approved_netuid(netuid, approved)`
(exposed after hand-off through the `vault_set_approved_netuid` forwarder).

Oracle reporter access (`set_reporter`) is managed by the oracle's validator; the validator and the
max price deviation are governance-set. The active round is committed by the validator via
`commit_round`; governance can also commit an emergency override price (see below).

Default per-netuid params:

- Collateral ratio: `150%`
- Liquidation ratio: `120%`
- Interest rate: `10% APR` (approximately `10.52% APY` under hourly compounding)
- Liquidation fee: `11%`

Default global params:

- Transaction fee: `0.3%` (30 bps)
- Auction duration: `3_600_000` milliseconds (1 hour)
- Max oracle age: `1_800_000` milliseconds (30 minutes)

## Governance & Treasury

### Authorities

`tusdt-governance` carries two roles in addition to token-holder voting:

- **Maintainer** — the top authority (the elected subnet owner). Set initially at construction and thereafter replaced **only** by the election contract via `elect_maintainer`. The maintainer seats the council (`set_council`), updates governance parameters (`update_params`), and drives the protocol config forwarders below.
  The election contract — instantiated by governance's constructor — runs the election and installs the winner as maintainer.
- **Council** — a fixed committee of exactly 5 members set by the maintainer. The council performs
  operational duties: committing voting snapshots (`submit_snapshot`) and the emergency vault halt
  (`vault_pause`). Any single council member can act on these.

### Token-holder proposals

Funding and signal proposals are decided by token-weighted voting against a committed Merkle
snapshot (voting power is `sqrt(snapshot balance) × time-staked multiplier`, so flash-staking can't
inflate it). Flow: `submit_proposal` → `vote` → `finalize` → `execute`. Submission is gated on the
proposer's subnet alpha stake and a monthly submission window; passing requires both quorum (a
fraction of circulating supply) and an approval threshold. A passed **Funding** proposal calls
`treasury.release(...)` on execution; **NonFunding** proposals are signal-only.

### Steering the protocol (forwarders)

After the role hand-off, the governance contract holds the `governance` role on the vault, auction,
and oracle. It exposes thin forwarders that perform the cross-contract call; the protocol contracts
see the governance contract as their `governance` caller. Authorization is decided inside
governance:

| Forwarder | Gated by | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vault_set_contract_params(netuid, params)`, `vault_cancel_contract_params_update(netuid)` | maintainer | vault-alpha (per-netuid timelocked params) |
| `vault_set_global_params(config)`, `vault_cancel_global_params_update()` | maintainer | vault-alpha (global timelocked params: fee, auction duration, oracle age) |
| `vault_set_approved_netuid(netuid, approved)` | maintainer | vault-alpha (accepted collateral subnets) |
| `vault_update_treasury`, `vault_update_platform`, `vault_unpause` | maintainer | vault-alpha |
| `vault_pause` | **council** (fast emergency halt) | vault-alpha |
| `oracle_set_validator`, `oracle_set_max_price_deviation` | maintainer | oracle |
| `oracle_commit_round` | maintainer (emergency price — drives liquidations) | oracle |
| `auction_set_admin` | maintainer | auction |

`update_governance` on the protocol contracts is intentionally **not** forwarded — the vault's role
is fixed after wiring (and it propagates role changes to the auction/oracle itself).

### Treasury

`tusdt-treasury` books protocol fees into named funds — `Emergency`, `Operation`, `Insurance`,
`Dividend`, `Buyback`, `Voting` — in both `Tusdt` and `Native` denominations. `distribute()` splits
incoming balance across the funds; `release(fund, token_kind, amount, recipient)` pays out and is
callable **only by governance** (i.e. via an executed Funding proposal). The deployer is the initial
governance until `set_governance` hands control to the governance contract.

## Useful Read Methods

- Vault: `get_vault`, `get_total_debt`, `get_contract_params(netuid)`, `get_global_params()`, `is_approved_netuid(netuid)`, `get_oracle_address`, `get_vaults`, `get_all_vaults`
- Oracle: `get_latest_price`, `get_current_round_summary`, `is_reporter`
- Chain extension: `get_alpha_price(netuid)` — on-chain subnet alpha/TAO price (RAO-scaled by 1e9)
- Oracle: `get_latest_price`, `get_current_round_summary`, `is_reporter`
- Auction: `get_auction`, `get_active_vault_auction`, `get_bid`, `get_all_auctions`, `get_active_auctions`
- Token: `balance_of`, `allowance`, `total_supply`
- Governance: `maintainer`, `election`, `netuid`, `council`, `is_council`, `params`, `current_epoch`, `get_snapshot`, `quorum`, `proposal_count`, `get_proposal`, `has_voted`
- Treasury: `governance`, `token`, `fund_balance_tusdt`, `fund_balance_native`
## Notes

- `tusdt-vault-alpha` owns the token and auction instances it creates; `tusdt-lending-pool` spawns its
  own lToken children (lTAO, lTUSDT) reusing the `tusdt-erc20` code hash.
- Alpha collateral is verified via chain extension (`get_stake_info`). Both the vault and lending pool
  act as coldkeys for staked alpha, using the caller-forwarded `caller_transfer_stake` (func 25) for
  atomic pull deposits.
- Pricing: `TUSDT_per_alpha = oracle_TUSDT_per_TAO * (get_alpha_price(netuid) / 1_000_000_000)`.
- Borrowing from the vault mints TUSDT to borrower; the lending pool transfers existing TUSDT (no mint
  on borrow — pool liquidity comes from suppliers).
- Vault repayment and settlement burn TUSDT; lending pool repayment keeps TUSDT as pool cash.
- Protocol fees accrue to `tusdt-treasury`; only `tusdt-governance` can release them.
- After wiring, the vault/auction/oracle/pool are governed by `tusdt-governance`; the maintainer and
  council act through its forwarders rather than calling those contracts directly.
- The lending pool uses direct bonus-based liquidation (not auctions). The existing `tusdt-auction`
  contract serves the vault's liquidation path only.
